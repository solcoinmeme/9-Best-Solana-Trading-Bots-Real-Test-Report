<b>9 Best Solana Trading Bots Real Test Report</b>


<p>Which bot is the best? From the dimensions of handling fees, security, user 
experience, functional advantages/features, etc., a detailed comparison of the 
current mainstream Solana trading bots is introduced.<br>
<br>
150,000 u can be deposited in 1 minute, and buying bots has become the most 
fashionable way to make money in the current market.<br>
The bot projects we often refer to are early projects that generally do not have 
white papers and have very shallow token trading depth. Most of these projects 
are short-lived, with a life cycle of 1-3 days. There are very few projects that 
can go out of the 100-fold market, and even go online on the exchange to become 
&quot;golden dogs&quot;, such as BOME, SLERF, PUNT, and ACT. Even if it is a game of 
probability, there are still many people who are trying to seize the opportunity 
to turn over a hundred times.<br>
From discovering bots to buying, it takes tens of seconds to a few minutes, 
depending on various factors such as network speed and GAS settings. The birth 
of Trading Bot, that is, the birth of trading robots, has greatly reduced the 
threshold for ordinary users to rush ahead. They only need to prepare the buying 
settings in advance, copy the contract address, and enter the buying amount.<br>
At present, the Bot track is relatively mature. According to Dune data, the top 
five bots in terms of trading volume are: BonkBot, Maestro, Banana Gun, Trojan, 
and Sol Trading Bot.<br>
<br>
In this article, we will introduce the current mainstream Solana trading bots in 
detail from the dimensions of handling fees, security, user experience, 
functional advantages/features, etc., and compare them with traditional DEX.
